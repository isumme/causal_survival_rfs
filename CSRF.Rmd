C-index = 0.6 means this model correctly ranks survival in 60% of patient pairs.

# CATEs (Individual-level treatment effect estimates) for each observation in the dataset

```{r}
# Get the estimated effect of RHC on 30-day survival for each individual
csf_preds <- predict(model)
cate_estimates <- csf_preds$predictions
summary(csf_preds$predictions)
```
For some individuals, RHC is estimated to reduce survival time by ~9 days. 25% of patients have an estimated treatment effect worse than -3 days (RHC harms them). For the median patient, RHC reduces 30-day survival by ~1.7 days. On average, RHC reduces 30-day survival by ~1.9 days. 75% of patients have treatment effects worse than -0.56 days. A small subset of patients actually benefit, gaining ~4 days from RHC.

# Distribution of effects

```{r}
# Distribution of effects
hist(cate_estimates, breaks = 50,
     main = "Estimated Treatment Effects 'CATEs'",
     xlab = "Effect of RHC on 30-Day Survival Probability")
```

The estimates suggest that RHC is harmful on average for 30-day survival, with most patients experiencing a decrease in survival ranging from ~1 to ~6 days. However, a minority of patients show positive treatment effects, suggesting treatment effect heterogeneity since some patients may benefit from RHC, depending on their characteristics.

```{r}
# Calculates quantiles of the CATE estimates
quantile(cate_estimates, probs = c(0.01, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.99))

# Add CATE estimates to the data frame so each patient's effect is stored
data_clean$CATE <- cate_estimates

# Groups patients into categories based on their estimated treatment effect (CATE)
data_clean$Effect_Group <- cut(data_clean$CATE,
                                breaks = c(-Inf, -0.05, 0.05, Inf),
                                labels = c("Harmed", "Neutral",
                                           "Benefitted"))
# Harmed if RHC reduces survival by more than 0.05 days
# Neutral if the effect is between +-0.05
# Benefitted if RHC increases survival by more than 0.05 days

# Count how many patients are into each effect group
table(data_clean$Effect_Group)
```
The model predicts that most patients (about 83%) are harmed by RHC in terms of 30-day survival. A small subset (about 13%) may benefit, and only around 2% appear unaffected. This supports the presence of treatment effect heterogeneity + justifies us investigating which subgroups these benefitted individuals belong to.
